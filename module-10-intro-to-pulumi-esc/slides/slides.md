# Module 10 - Intro to Pulumi ESC - üåê Overview

Pulumi ESC aims to consolidate secrets and configuration management under a single umbrella via Environments. It offers a uniform consumption interface regardless of where secrets reside. ESC manages the lifecycle of secrets and configurations, sharing them with developers, CI/CD systems, Pulumi programs, and more. It allows for secrets to be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD) with minimal to no disruption to consumers, facilitating seamless migrations between secret management solutions.

## Module 10 - Intro to Pulumi ESC - CRUD Operations

You can manage Pulumi ESC Environments in several ways. Below are common use cases for each method:

- **Pulumi ESC CLI**:
  - Use ESC independently of Pulumi IaC, e.g., for application development
  - Combine with other shell commands
  - Scripting

- **Pulumi CLI (via the `pulumi esc` command)**:
  - If you already have Pulumi installed and/or use other Pulumi Cloud services
  - Scripting

- **Pulumi Cloud REST API**:
  - Mostly for read-only operations such as integrating with monitoring/compliance tools like PagerDuty, Splunk, Slack, and webhooks.

- **SDKs**:
  - Align with GitOps practices
  - Pulumi Service Provider for managing all Pulumi Cloud resources
  - ESC Provider for managing ESC-related resources

## Module 10 - Intro to Pulumi ESC - Consumers

ESC can be consumed in various ways:

- **As Environment Variables**:
  - Loaded via the ESC CLI or the Pulumi CLI
  - Great for app development/scripting

- **Within Pulumi Programs**:
  - Referenced in the Stack file
  - Via SDKs
  - Great when in a CI/CD pipeline and the Pulumi GitHub Actions
